## About
This is a tribute to [whatsbetter.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20040602034418/http://whatsbetter.com/) that mysteriously disappeared in early 2005. It was also an excuse to build something using Phoenix and rethinkdb.

Essentially, you are presented with two items and you click on the item that you think is better.
